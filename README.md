Approved Animal Drug Products 
The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Restoration act requires that each sponsor of an approved animal drug must submit to the FDA certain information regarding patents held for the animal drug or its method of use. The Act requires that this information, as well as a list of all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness, be made available to the public.

So I have created a web application using microsoft visual studio with a collection of awesome .NET libraries, tools, frameworks, and software.
